          Conclusions
         </h3>
         <p>
          This section is included only when a reference
          <abbr acid="" title="“deoxyribonucleic">
           DNA
          </abbr>
          sample from a known individual has been tested, and the resulting
          <abbr acid="" title="“deoxyribonucleic">
           DNA
          </abbr>
          profile is compared to another
          <abbr acid="" title="“deoxyribonucleic">
           DNA
          </abbr>
          profile generated within the case, to determine whether or not the individual could be excluded as its source.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are two possible outcomes of such a comparison (if a reference sample profile has not been compared to a particular unknown
          <abbr acid="" title="“deoxyribonucleic">
           DNA

          The term

           cannot be excluded
          </cite>
          means that either the person in question is the source/a contributor or the person is not and a coincidence has occurred. The possibility of such a coincidence depends on how common the unknown
          <abbr acid="" title="“deoxyribonucleic">
           DNA
          </abbr>
          profile is and how likely it is to be shared by different people in the population at large. A finding that an individual
          <cite>
           cannot be excluded
          </cite>
          is assessed by scientists in this context and will be followed in the report by one of two estimates:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           The Random Match Probability (RMP)
           <p>
            The probability that a randomly selected individual unrelated to the known individual would coincidentally share the unknown
            <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">
             <abbr acid="" title="“deoxyribonucleic">
              DNA
             </abbr>
            </abbr>
            profile.  Random Match Probabilities are particularly useful when assessing single-source
            <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">
             <abbr acid="" title="“deoxyribonucleic">
              DNA
             </abbr>
            </abbr>
            profiles (including those derived from mixtures).
           </p>
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           The Likelihood Ratio (LR)
           <p>
            A ratio of two different probabilities: the probability of having observed the
            <abbr acid="" title="“deoxyribonucleic">
             DNA
            </abbr>
            results under one proposition (for instance, a mixture is comprised of
            <abbr acid="" title="“deoxyribonucleic">
             DNA
            </abbr>
            from both the complainant and the suspect) divided by the probability of having observed the same results under an alternate proposition (for instance, the mixture is comprised of
            <abbr acid="" title="“deoxyribonucleic">
             DNA
            </abbr>
            from two people unrelated to the complainant and the suspect).
           </p>
           <p>
            A
            <abbr ratio="" title="“Liklihood">
             LR
            </abbr>
            greater than 1 provides support for the first proposition, with higher numbers providing more support. Conversely, a
            <abbr ratio="" title="“Liklihood">
             LR
            </abbr>
            of less than 1 provides more support for the second proposition. LRs address the probability of
            <abbr acid="" title="“deoxyribonucleic">
             DNA
            </abbr>
            test results under different propositions, not the probability of the propositions themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            LRs should, especially when lower (e.g. 1-1000), be considered along with other information in the case when deciding which proposition is more likely.
           </p>
           <p>
            LRs are particularly useful when assessing mixtures of
            <abbr acid="" title="“deoxyribonucleic">
             DNA
            </abbr>
            but may be used for single-source profiles as well. They are also used routinely in familial
            <abbr acid="" title="“deoxyribonucleic">
             DNA
            </abbr>
            applications such as paternity tests. One advantage of the
            <abbr ratio="" title="“Liklihood">
             LR
            </abbr>
            relative to the
            <abbr match="" probability="" title="“Random">
             RMP
            </abbr>
            is that various different propositions for observed test results can be weighed against each other.
           </p>
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Statistical estimates are based on established principles of population genetics and involve reference to
          <abbr acid="" title="“deoxyribonucleic">
           DNA
          </abbr>
          population data. For standard

           STR
          </abbr>
          <abbr acid="" title="“deoxyribonucleic">
           DNA
          </abbr>
          analyses, Ontario population databases for Asians, Blacks, Caucasians, East Indians, and Northern Ontario Natives are used.  The true value may vary from calculated estimates by as much as 10-fold lower or higher. For male-specific Y-chromosome
          <abbr repeat="" tandem="" title="“short">
           STR
          </abbr>
          analyses, due to the unavailability of data specific to the Ontario population, the US National Database within the Y-Chromosome Reference Haplotype Database (YHRD) is used to derive statistical estimates.  North American population databases for African Americans, Asians, Caucasians, Hispanics and Native Americans are used.  Estimates are calculated in each available population group and a combined
          <abbr ratio="" title="“Liklihood">
           LR
          </abbr>
          is included in the report.  It is important to note that when an individual cannot be excluded as the donor of a Y-
          <abbr repeat="" tandem="" title="“short">
           STR
          </abbr>
          profile, we may also not be able to exclude his patrilineal male relatives.
         </p>
         <p>
          For clarity of understanding, it is the Centre’s policy that a maximum value of 1 trillion will be reported for both the
          <abbr match="" probability="" title="“Random">
           RMP
          </abbr>
          (i.e. 1 in greater than 1 trillion) and the
          <abbr ratio="" title="“Liklihood">
           LR
          </abbr>
          (i.e. greater than 1 trillion times more likely) when calculated values exceed this number. Additionally, when different
          <abbr match="" probability="" title="“Random">
           RMP
          </abbr>
          or
          <abbr ratio="" title="“Liklihood">
           LR
          </abbr>
          values are obtained, with respect to the same individual not being excluded from multiple sub-items, these may be reported as a range.

          Testing Summary
         </h3>
         <p>
          This section contains a table in which bodily fluid screening and
          <abbr acid="" title="“deoxyribonucleic">
           DNA
          </abbr>
          testing results are summarized for each item examined. Reference samples are not described in the table. If the sole purpose of the examination was to generate a
          <abbr acid="" title="“deoxyribonucleic">
           DNA
          </abbr>
          profile from a known individual (i.e. a reference sample) for comparison to previously reported
          <abbr acid="" title="“deoxyribonucleic">
           DNA
          </abbr>
          profiles, this section will not be present in the report. The single exception will occur when a comparison is made via a cast-off or discard sample (e.g. a cigarette butt); that type of reference sample (thought to originate from a known individual) will appear in the testing summary table with an evaluation of the
          <abbr acid="" title="“deoxyribonucleic">
           DNA
          </abbr>
          typing profile obtained.
         </p>
         <p>
          In scenarios where a preliminary assessment of multiple items is conducted in order to determine an appropriate sequence of examination or to select a subset of items for further examination, this preliminary examination strategy will be reflected in the report as “Preliminary assessment only at this time”.
         </p>

          <abbr forensic="" of="" sciences="" title="“Centre">
           CFS
          </abbr>
          item numbers are generated and assigned at the time of submission. If a sample is taken from an item at the
          <abbr forensic="" of="" sciences="" title="“Centre">
           CFS
          </abbr>
          for further analysis, it is assigned a sub-item number that is based on the parent item. For example, a swab of a blood stain on a jacket that has been designated item 4 by the
          <abbr forensic="" of="" sciences="" title="“Centre">
           CFS
          </abbr>
          will be assigned a sub-item number such as 4-1. Multiple sub-items may be generated for an item, each with a unique and sequential sub-item number, such as 4-2, 4-3, etc.
         </p>
         <p>
          Sub-items may be collected from an item at the
          <abbr forensic="" of="" sciences="" title="“Centre">
           CFS
          </abbr>
          for further analysis by various techniques, such as cutting out a portion of fabric, swabbing a surface, or taping a surface.
         </p>
         <p>
          Items listed in the table are typically grouped by source or scene.

         <h4 class="h4">
          Description (sub-item)
         </h4>
         <p>
          Brief descriptions are provided for each item and sub-item included in the table. Sub-items also include a description of the location of sampling as well as the sampling technique used.
         </p>
         <h4 class="h4">
          Bodily Fluid Screening
         </h4>
         <p>
          Screening test results are summarized for both parent items and sub-items. For a parent item, these include a concise and descriptive overview of findings for the item as a whole, to the extent it was examined. Scientists apply their professional judgement in determining the extent to which an item is examined. For a sub-item, specific test results from the area in which the sub-item was collected are included.
         </p>
         <p>
          For each bodily fluid, results of tests may be reported as “detected”, “suggested”, “inconclusive”, or “not detected”. Combinations of test results leading to each reported outcome are described in Table 1. The

            DNA

           testing” covers a wide range of applications. The analysis of autosomal Short Tandem Repeats, or STRs (those present on the chromosomes not associated with biological sex) generally provides the strongest support for identifying the person from whom a sample originated. The analysis of lineage

            DNA
           </abbr>
           markers (including male-specific Y-chromosome STRs) provides generally less discriminating test results but has other unique advantages which may be important in select cases.

             This test is used to localize possible saliva stains on items, through the detection of amylase. Amylase is a protein often found in high levels in saliva but it can also be found in other bodily substances such as feces, perspiration, vaginal secretions and semen.
