           The aim of this presumptive test is to determine whether a questioned stain yields a positive colour reaction which suggests the presence of blood. This is a 3-stage chemical test that gives a pink colour reaction in the presence of hemoglobin. This can be performed by applying the chemicals directly to a questioned stain (direct test) or by applying the chemicals to a filter paper onto which a portion of the stain has been transferred (rub test).

          Semen
         </h4>
         <p class="normal">
          Semen is a liquid from the male reproductive system that usually contains spermatozoa (sperm cells) along with various other substances. Mature males emit semen during ejaculation. The spermatozoon (singular of spermatozoa) is the male reproductive cell. Human semen usually contains high levels of a substance called acid phosphatase. Acid phosphatase has a chemical activity, which allows for its detection. Human semen also contains high levels of a substance called p30, which, with few exceptions, is specific to semen.
