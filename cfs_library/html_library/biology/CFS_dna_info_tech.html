          is the genetic blueprint of life and is packaged into paired structures known as chromosomes. One from each pair is contributed by an individual’s biological mother and the other by his/her biological father. With the exception of identical twins, no two individuals have exactly the same
          <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">

          One particular pair of chromosomes includes the information required for gender determination. In males, one of the two chromosomes in this pair is known as the X chromosome, while the other is known as the Y chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes. A father passes his Y chromosome, unaltered, to each of his sons. This means that all paternally related males are expected to have the same Y chromosome

           DNA

          This estimate is only valid for unrelated people, as there would be a greater probability of coincidental matching

          The estimate is specific to the pair of hypotheses being tested. These hypotheses are formulated by the Scientist in considering the relevant question(s) to be answered and will represent two alternative explanations for the data. Different sets of hypotheses will result in different likelihood ratios. In certain scenarios it may be relevant to address alternate hypotheses involving familial relationships.
