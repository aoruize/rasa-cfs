          Fibre examination
         </h4>
         <p>
          In some forensic cases the only fibre examination required is one of fibre identification (
          <abbr title="example">
           e.g.
          </abbr>
          investigative cases). In other cases, fibre identification and comparison are done to investigate a possible association between two or more sources.
         </p>
         <h4 class="h4">
          Fibre identification
         </h4>
         <p>
          The generic class/sub-class of a fibre is determined using bright field microscopy and, when needed, one or more of the following methods:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           polarized light microscopy
          </li>
          <li>
           natural fibre tests (staining and physical tests)
          </li>
          <li>
           Fourier Transform Infrared Microspectroscopy (
           <abbr>
            FTIR
           </abbr>
           )
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The identification of natural fibres is not always conclusive. In particular, extensively processed fibres may be difficult to identify.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ancient or rare fibres, which are not in our reference collection, may not be considered in our fibre evaluation.
         </p>
         <p>
          Fibres are identified by testing them to the point where no other fibre type would give the same combination of results.
         </p>
         <h4 class="h4">
          Fibre comparison
         </h4>
         <p>
          Transferred fibres are removed from evidentiary items via taping or direct removal.
         </p>
         <p>
          Unknown fibres are screened on tapings and selected for comparison to known samples based on stereomicroscopic appearance. No association or conclusion can be made about the remaining unknown fibres on the tapes since they do not relate to any known comparison sample.
         </p>
         <p>
          Occasionally, numerous fibres of the same apparent fibre type/colour are detected on tapings from one individual/object, which are not similar to any known sample submitted in the case. These fibres may be used for comparison with fibres on tapings from another individual/object. These would be reported as “extraneous fibres in-common, of no known source”.
         </p>
         <p>
          Fibre comparison is done using one or more of the following methods:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           bright field comparison microscopy
          </li>
          <li>
           fluorescence comparison microscopy
          </li>
          <li>
           microspectrophotometry (
           <abbr>
            MSP
           </abbr>
           )
          </li>
          <li>
           Raman spectroscopy (
           <abbr>
            RS
           </abbr>
           )
          </li>
         </ul>
         <h4 class="h4">
          Significance of fibre evidence
         </h4>
         <p>
          Since textile materials are usually mass-produced, it generally cannot be said that a fibre came from one particular garment and no other. If in all the methods performed, an example of sample reporting results and conclusions would be:
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Results when no differences are found between fibres are reported as:
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p class="normal">
          “Fibres were indistinguishable in microscopic appearance (
          <abbr title="example">
           e.g.
          </abbr>
          configuration, diameter, delustrant and cross-section), composition (
          <abbr title="example">
           e.g.
          </abbr>
          cotton, polyester) and colour.”
         </p>
         <p>
          From the fibres above, a sample was selected for RAMAN analysis and was found to be indistinguishable in dye colour components from the fibres comprising the known item.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Conclusions when no differences are found between fibres are reported as:
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          “The known item could not be eliminated as a possible source of the extraneous fibres collected from the unknown item. Therefore, the extraneous fibres collected from the unknown item either came from the known item or from another source of fibres that are indistinguishable with respect to the properties listed in the results.
         </p>
         <p>
          Textile fibres can be transferred between individuals, or between individuals and objects, or between objects. The number of fibres transferred and retained (persistence) is dependent on various factors (
          <abbr title="example">
           e.g.
          </abbr>
          nature of recipient fabric/surface, time since transfer,
          <abbr title="et cetera">
           etc.
          </abbr>
          )
         </p>
         <p>
          There may be factors which increase the significance of unknown fibres being indistinguishable from the fibres of a comparison sample (
          <abbr title="example">
           e.g.
          </abbr>
          the fibres are of an uncommon type).
         </p>
         <p>
          There may be factors which decrease the significance of unknown fibres being indistinguishable from the fibres of a comparison sample (
          <abbr title="example">
           e.g.
          </abbr>
          few fibres found, or the fibre type is very common).
         </p>
         <p>
          There may be factors which decrease the significance of a fibre association between two individuals (
          <abbr title="example">
           e.g.
          </abbr>
          previous legitimate contact between the parties involved).
         </p>
         <p>
          There may be factors which increase the significance of a fibre association between two individuals (
          <abbr title="example">
           e.g.
          </abbr>
          cross transfer involving several fibre types).

         </p>
         <p>
          Finding no fibre association between individuals may or may not be significant, depending upon the circumstances.
