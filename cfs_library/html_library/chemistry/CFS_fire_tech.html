           Introduction
          </strong>
         </h4>
         <p class="normal">
          Items collected in the investigation of a fire can be examined at the laboratory for the presence of ignitable liquids and/or hydrocarbon gases. When these liquids or gases are used to set, spread or increase the intensity of a fire, they are referred to as “accelerants.” Items related to a fire may include burnt debris, clothing, or samples of liquid. The identification of ignitable liquids and/or hydrocarbon gases in submitted items does not necessarily indicate that the crime of arson has been committed. All laboratory results must be evaluated in the context of the fire investigation.
         </p>
         <h4 class="h4">
          <strong>
           Packaging
          </strong>
         </h4>
         <p class="normal">
          When packaging items suspected of containing ignitable liquids and/or hydrocarbon gases, it is vital that a protective barrier is provided against evaporation from the container and from external contamination. Recommended packaging includes glass Mason jars and specialty nylon bags. Common plastic bags are not acceptable. Samples of liquid should be submitted in glass vials with foil-lined lids.
         </p>
         <h4 class="h4">
          <strong>
           Examination
          </strong>
         </h4>
         <h5 class="h5">
          Visual Examination
         </h5>
         <p class="normal">
          All items are visually examined to check any seal numbers, the contents and the integrity of the packaging. Instrumental Analysis Samples of vapour or liquid are removed from the items, using a syringe, for analysis by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Gas chromatography is a standard analytical technique that separates the components of a sample and generates a chart known as a chromatogram. Ignitable liquids are identified by their distinctive patterns in these chromatograms. Mass spectrometry assists in classifying and identifying the components of the sample. This is a qualitative analysis and does not determine the quantity of an ignitable liquid identified in an item.

          Liquid Recovery
         </h5>
         <p class="normal">
          Liquid recovery by steam distillation may be undertaken when the results of instrumental analysis indicate that liquid recovery may be possible. Quantities of liquid recovered by distillation cannot be correlated to the total volume of liquid originally present at a scene.
         </p>
         <h5 class="h5">
          Polymer Identification
         </h5>
         <p class="normal">
          Polymer identification may be requested to identify the type of polymer (plastic) in an item. This may help to determine if the plastic could have originated from a fuel container.
         </p>
         <h5 class="h5">
          Oils Analysis
         </h5>
         <p class="normal">
          Oils analysis may be requested to identify mineral or vegetable/cooking oils in an item.
         </p>
         <h4 class="h4">
          <strong>
           Interpretation
          </strong>
         </h4>
         <p class="normal">
          An unused Mason jar should be submitted for comparison purposes. This comparison jar and the associated item jars should have an identical cleaning, storage, and handling history. Comparison jars may be analyzed to address the possibility that the identification of ignitable liquids in jarred items could have been contributed by contamination of the jars prior to use, or cross-transfer from other items during storage and handling.  Certain types of debris may contain background materials that can affect ignitable liquids analysis. The investigator may submit comparison samples to assist with identification and/or interpretation of any ignitable liquids identified in such types of debris. Some ignitable liquids, such as turpentine and styrene, may naturally originate from materials present in the debris, and will therefore not routinely be reported. Unless requested by the investigator or otherwise stated in the report, no attempt is made to specifically identify the debris in submitted items.
