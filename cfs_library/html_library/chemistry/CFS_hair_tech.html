          Hair identification
         </h4>
         <p>
          The identification of hairs involves the macroscopic examination and low power (4x to 64x) stereomicroscopic examination of external characteristics, such as colour, coarseness, length, cross-section (
          <abbr title="example">
           e.g.
          </abbr>
          round, oval or flat), configuration (
          <abbr title="example">
           e.g.
          </abbr>
          kinked, buckled), and root and tip appearance. It may also involve the examination of the various internal components of a hair (cuticle, cortex, medulla) by bright field microscopy at high (300x) magnification.
         </p>
         <p>
          With respect to hairs, the examiner can determine one or more of the following (list not all-inclusive):
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           human or animal
          </li>
          <li>
           family/species of animal
          </li>
          <li>
           human body origin
          </li>
          <li>
           damage (
           <abbr title="example">
            e.g.
           </abbr>
           singeing)
          </li>
          <li>
           treatments (
           <abbr title="example">
            e.g
           </abbr>
           . dyeing)
          </li>
          <li>
           condition of root (
           <abbr title="that is">
            i.e.
           </abbr>
           indication of hair having fallen naturally, or forcibly removed, and suitability for nuclear
           <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">
            DNA
           </abbr>
           analysis)
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The body origin of a human hair can be identified if it is intact, mature and has characteristics which exclude it from other hair types (notwithstanding the possibility of atypical hairs). There can be an overlap in the characteristics of human hair types. For example, a less mature pubic hair can look like a chest hair, or an immature scalp hair may resemble fine body hairs. Hair identifications are reported to include the likely types (not including atypical possibilities).
         </p>
         <p>
          Animals have coarse guard hairs and fine underfur hairs. Guard hairs can be identified as to the family, or sometimes species of origin. Underfur hairs cannot be identified as to family or species.
         </p>
         <h4 class="h4">
          Hair screening
         </h4>
         <p>
          Hair screening is done as a prelude to further testing (nuclear or mitochondrial
          <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">
           DNA
          </abbr>
          analysis).  During hair screening, the external characteristics, such as colour, width, length, and configuration of unknown hairs may be examined in order to select the hairs for further examination. The hair roots may be assessed to determine whether they are suitable for attempting nuclear
          <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">
           DNA
          </abbr>
          analysis or suitable for attempting mitochondrial
          <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">
           DNA
          </abbr>
          analysis.
         </p>
         <p>
          Occasionally, unnaturally dyed hairs are examined by microspectrophotometry and Raman Spectroscopy.
         </p>
         <h4 class="h4">
          Damaged hair
         </h4>
         <p>
          Hair can be examined for damage, such as heat, crushing or cutting, or to see if it has been forcibly removed.
         </p>
         <h4 class="h4">
          Transfer and persistence of hairs
         </h4>
         <p>
          Hairs can be transferred between individuals, or between individuals and objects, or between objects. The number of hairs transferred and retained (persistence) is dependent on various factors (
          <abbr title="example">
           e.g.
          </abbr>
          nature of recipient fabric/surface, time since transfer,
          <abbr title="et cetera">
           etc.
          </abbr>
          ).
         </p>
         <p>
          Examination for an unknown/foreign hair from an individual will normally not be undertaken if the parties are known to each other or have shared a common environment as hairs may be transferred between people through daily activities.
         </p>
         <p>
          The presence of one or two forcibly removed hairs may arise as a result of normal daily activities such as grooming.
