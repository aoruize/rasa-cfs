          Purpose
         </h4>
         <p>
          Textile damage assessment may assist to answer various types of questions in the forensic examination of a garment or other fabric products. For example:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Cuts, tears and seam separations present on articles of clothing may be significant when violence is alleged to have been part of an incident or when an act of mischief is believed to have occurred.
          </li>
          <li>
           Cuts or tears may be associated to a type of implement, and even to a particular implement (when fibres on it are indistinguishable to fibres comprising the damaged garment).
          </li>
          <li>
           The presence of abrasions, tears or slash cuts may assist to localize points of contact on a vehicle in pedestrian hit and run accidents, or inside a vehicle in relation to its driver or passengers.
          </li>
          <li>
           The presence of thermal damage on a garment may be significant in an arson case.
          </li>
          <li>
           Discoloured areas may be significant on a garment from an individual who is suspected of having done a bleach clean-up of a scene.
          </li>
          <li>
           It may be possible to obtain a physical match when comparing two (or more) damaged items from different sources and conclude that they were once part of the same item.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Damage can be identified as to belonging to one of the following four stages when referring to its recency:
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Recent
          </strong>
          - Damage characteristics observed indicate that the item has not been laundered or extensively worn/used* since the damage occurred.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Non-recent
          </strong>
          - Damage characteristics observed indicate that the item has been laundered or extensively worn/used* since the damage occurred.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Inconclusive
          </strong>
          - Damage that has a combination of recent and non-recent damage characteristics.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Indeterminate
          </strong>
          - Damage characteristics observed do not change with laundering and/or extensive wear/use. They remain the same over time (
          <abbr title="for example">
           e.g.
          </abbr>
          missing zipper pull).
         </p>
         <p>
          *
          <strong>
           Extensively worn/used
          </strong>
          - Items when worn/used are flexed and abraded when in contact with themselves and/or other surfaces. If this occurs after the damage has occurred, it results in changes to any damage characteristics observed.
         </p>
         <h4 class="h4">
          Analysis
         </h4>
         <p>
          Textile damage assessment is performed by a macroscopic and stereomicroscopic examination of the item and typically involves performing damage tests, if possible, on the same article being examined or another article of similar construction, sometimes with a submitted implement.
         </p>
         <p>
          The damage is assessed by general observations relative to the construction and general appearance of the item, and by determination of the characteristics the fabric edges, yarn ends, and fibre ends.
         </p>
         <h4 class="h4">
          Significance
         </h4>
         <p>
          Damage is influenced by a number of different factors, including fabric construction and fibre composition.
         </p>
         <p>
          Some types of textile damage may occur during normal wear, such as surface abrasions, pilling, broken threads, unravelling, stretching/distortion, and environmental discolouration.
         </p>
         <p>
          It may be difficult to visualize the details that characterize the damage if it is not recent and/or small or, if the edges are coated with blood or affected by environmental exposure.
         </p>
         <p>
          Although not quantified, a general assessment of the force required to create textile damage may be possible, based on knowledge of fabric construction and damage tests.
