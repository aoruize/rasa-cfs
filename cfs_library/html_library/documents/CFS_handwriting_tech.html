           Introduction
          </strong>
         </h5>
         <p class="normal">
          Forensic handwriting examination involves the examination and comparison of handwriting and signatures and often includes magnification with a hand lens and/or stereomicroscope.

           Principle of Handwriting Identification
          </strong>
         </h5>
         <p class="normal">
          Two writings are the product of one person if the similarities, taken in combination, are sufficiently individual and there are no fundamental differences. The identification of signatures constitutes a special branch of handwriting identification in which letter design is considered in conjunction with the factors related to the execution of the signature. It is the combination of writing quality and form that identifies a signature.

           Examinations

         </h5>
         <p class="normal">
          Handwriting examinations include the following steps:

         <ul type="disc">
          <li class="ListBullet">
           The questioned and known items are examined to determine/assess their suitability for comparison (i.e. physical condition, comparable letter forms)
          </li>
          <li class="ListBullet">
           Assessment of the naturalness or distorted appearance of the questioned and/or known writing
          </li>
          <li class="ListBullet">
           A side-by-side comparison of known and questioned writings is conducted, noting any similarities and differences in characteristics
          </li>
          <li class="ListBullet">
           A conclusion is reached based on an assessment of the significance of similarities and differences

           Identification:
          </strong>
         </h6>
         <p class="normal">
          An identification means the combination of similarities points strongly towards two or more handwritten items having been written by the same person.  There are no fundamental differences to suggest another writer. Identifications are made within the limits of practical certainty
          <sup>

          </sup>
          <strong>
           practical certainty -
          </strong>
          Since it is not possible to collect and examine samples of everyone’s handwriting it is not possible to make an identification with absolute certainty. However, all scientific research to date and the continuous inability to disprove the principle that no two people share the same combination of handwriting habits have demonstrated that even without a numerical threshold, handwriting examiners can reliably make identifications.
         </p>
         <h6 class="h6">
          <strong>
           Probable identification:
          </strong>
         </h6>
         <p class="normal">
          This is a qualified conclusion in which the combination of similarities points strongly towards two or more handwritten items having been written by the same person.  There are no fundamental differences to suggest another writer; however, there were limitation(s) in the examination.
         </p>
         <h6 class="h6">
          <strong>
           Elimination:
          </strong>
         </h6>
         <p class="normal">
          Elimination means that a known writer did not write the questioned writing.
         </p>
         <h6 class="h6">
          <strong>
           Probable elimination:
          </strong>
         </h6>
         <p class="normal">
          This is a qualified conclusion in which comparison of the questioned to the known writings revealed some differences. These differences may not be fundamental, but they do point strongly toward two or more handwritten items having been written by different persons. This conclusion means the Forensic Document Examiner cannot preclude the slight or theoretical possibility that the two items were written by the same person.
         </p>
         <h6 class="h6">
          <strong>
           Unable to determine:
          </strong>
         </h6>
         <p class="normal">
          An “unable to determine” or “unable to identify or eliminate” conclusion means it cannot be concluded whether or not the known writer wrote the questioned items.
