           Introduction

         </h5>
         <p class="normal">
          Cases involving alterations, erasures, obliterations, decipherment or cases involving the authentication of documents may require ink examinations. These examinations are based on differences in the inks/substances physical characteristics, chemical composition and optical properties.
         </p>
         <p class="normal">
          A specimen, when excited by incident visible/infrared radiation, depending on the properties of the specimen and the combination of excitation wavelength and viewing wavelength, may be observed to:

           Examination
          </strong>
         </h5>
         <p class="normal">
          Ink examinations are limited to ink differentiation and non-destructive techniques such as visual unaided/microscopic observations (colour, ink line morphology, interaction of the ink line with the substrate) and responses in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The main instrument used to aid in ink differentiation is a Video Spectral Comparator (VSC) 6000.

           Inks having the same physical characteristics (e.g. colour and pen type) and optical properties that appear on the same document may still be different.
          </li>
          <li class="ListBullet">
           Ink(s) on different documents cannot be compared since any observed differences may be due to the composition/components of the substrate and the conditions under which the documents were stored.
          </li>
          <li class="ListBullet">
           Inks on documents that have been chemically altered/stained (e.g. fingerprinting process) are considered contaminated and cannot be subjected to an ink examination.

          <li class="ListBullet">
           The Documents Unit at the Centre of Forensic Sciences is not equipped to perform examinations involving chemical ink identification or ink dating.
          </li>
          <li class="ListBullet">
           The non-destructive tests employed cannot be used to conclude the date of an inked entry. However, the physical characteristics of the pen/ink type may be used to establish the earliest date that the ink/pen could have been used.

          • It is possible, under certain conditions, to conclude that two inks are different.

          • Inks

          • It is not possible to determine when alterations occurred or with what intent (i.e. correction vs. spurious)
