          The Suspicious Firearms Index (
          <abbr>
           SFI
          </abbr>
          ) initiative is a streamlined process that provides police agencies with investigative information regarding whether a seized/recovered firearm is linked to a shooting occurrence through the upload of test fired ammunition components to the Canadian Integrated Ballistics Identification Network (
          <abbr>
           CIBIN
          </abbr>
          ) database. Those images could also be compared to the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (
          <abbr>
           NIBIN
          </abbr>
          ) database in the United States of America (U.S.A.) where information indicates that the firearm may have originated or passed through the
          <abbr title="United States of America">
           U.S.A.
          </abbr>
          Submissions under this initiative consist of either a commercial firearm or agency generated test fired ammunition components.

         <p class="normal">
          <strong>
           Note:
          </strong>
          A full examination of the firearm will not be conducted (
