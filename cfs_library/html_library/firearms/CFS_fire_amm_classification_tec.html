           Introduction
          </strong>
         </h4>
         <p class="normal">
          Section 2 of The Criminal Code of Canada provides the definition of a firearm.Section 84(1) of The Criminal Code subdivides firearms into specific classes and defines the factors required for an item to be included in a specific class. The classes include firearms, restricted firearms, prohibited firearms, replica firearms, and antique firearms. Submitted items are examined in order to determine to which class they belong.
         </p>
         <p class="normal">
          To be defined as a firearm, an item must meet three requirements. First, it must be a barrelled weapon. Second, it must be capable of discharging any shot, bullet or other projectile. Third, the projectiles must be capable of causing serious bodily injury or death to a person. It includes any frame or receiver of such a barrelled weapon and anything that can be adapted for use as a firearm.
         </p>
         <p class="normal">
          Air guns are accepted for classification purposes when they have been used in the commission of an offence.
         </p>
         <p class="normal">
          Section 84 of The Criminal Code provides a definition for ammunition and subdivides ammunition into two categories; ammunition and prohibited ammunition. Cartridge cases and projectiles can be further classified by their construction, profile and type. Cartridge cases can be differentiated into rimfire or centre fire.
         </p>
