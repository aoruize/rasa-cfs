           Introduction
          </strong>
         </h4>
         <p class="normal">
          Scientific research to date has shown that no two firearms will produce the same unique marks on projectiles and cartridge cases. These unique marks or individual characteristics are produced by randomly created flaws and imperfections that are produced during the firearm’s manufacturing processes as well as due to wear and tear. Based on this principle, a Firearms Examiner can identify ammunition components as having been chambered in, fired from, extracted, and ejected from a particular firearm (see note). The identification is based on a microscopic comparison of the submitted projectile(s) or cartridge case(s) to tests fired in the suspect firearm.
         </p>
         <p class="normal">
          Barrels of rifles and handguns are manufactured with alternating elevated lands and recessed grooves that are called ‘rifling’. The rifled barrel transfers its unique marks to the projectile when the projectile is fired from the firearm. The number, direction and width of these lands and grooves is class specific, and will vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. Once the class characteristics of the submitted projectile(s) and the suspect firearm are examined and found to be in agreement, the individual characteristics are then microscopically examined. If the individual characteristics are in agreement, the examiner may conclude that the projectile was fired from a particular firearm (see note).
         </p>
         <p class="normal">
          Cartridge cases come into contact with various parts of the firearm when the cartridge case is fired and/or cycled through the firearm. The cartridge case may possess magazine marks, and/or chamber marks, and/or extractor and ejector marks, and/or firing pin impressions, and/or breechface marks, as well as others. The individual characteristics left by the various firearm components on the surface of the cartridge case allows an Examiner to conduct a microscopic comparison of the marks, and potentially conclude that a cartridge case had been loaded in, chambered in, extracted from, ejected or fired in a particular firearm (see note).
         </p>
         <p class="normal">
          In the cases where a suspect firearm is not recovered, the class characteristics of the projectile(s) and/or cartridge case(s) can be searched according to manufacturer in the General Rifling Characteristics (GRC) database. This database was created by the F.B.I. and provides a list summarizing the possible firearms that may have fired the submitted projectile(s)/cartridge case(s). The GRC search can provide investigative leads and can be used as a screening tool. Although this database is continuously being updated, it has limitations in that it may not include every single firearm, including homemade firearms and some after-market alterations.

However all scientific research and testing to date and the continuous inability to disprove the principles of toolmark analysis have demonstrated that firearms produce unique, identifiable characteristics which allow examiners to reliably make identifications.
