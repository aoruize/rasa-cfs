          Introduction
         </h4>
         <p>
          The
          <cite>
           Criminal Code
          </cite>
          of Canada (CCC) does not provide a definition of a suppressor however Section 84 of the
          <abbr title="Criminal Code">
           CCC
          </abbr>
          provides the definition that pertains to suppressors as a prohibited device. A prohibited device is “a device or contrivance designed or intended to muffle or stop the sound or report of a firearm”.  It should be noted that the design element is the primary determining factor when evaluating whether or not a device is a prohibited device. The device’s ability to attenuate the sound of a gunshot merely provides additional supporting data.

         <ul>
          <li>
           the examination may include the following:
          </li>
          <li>
           identifying the make, model and calibre
          </li>
          <li>
           documenting the construction/design
          </li>
          <li>
           identifying the components and determining if these are typical of those used in the manufacturing of suppressors

          <li>
           determining whether there is a suitable firearm that the device may be attached to

          Interpretation

         <p>
          For classification of a suspected suppressor, possible conclusions are:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           the Item X device is a “Prohibited Device” as defined in Section 84 of the
           <cite>
            Criminal Code
           </cite>
           of Canada
          </li>
          <li>
           the Item X device is not a “Prohibited Device” as defined in Section 84 of the
           <cite>
            Criminal Code

          <strong>
           Baffles
          </strong>
          - Components used to restrain the flow of gas generated during the discharge of a firearm, or to prevent the spreading of sound in a particular direction.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Bleed holes
          </strong>
          - Holes drilled in the barrel of a firearm which permit gases to escape into a chamber or chambers, thereby decreasing the ballistic pressure and reducing the velocity of a bullet to a subsonic speed. May also be referred to as port holes or gas ports.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Expansion Chamber -
          </strong>
          A contained area for gases to be restrained and expand.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Report -
          </strong>
          A combination of sounds produced by the discharge of a firearm, including but not limited to mechanical noise, sonic crack, and muzzle blast.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Sound level meter -
          </strong>
          A device used for acoustic measurements.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Suppressor -
          </strong>
          A device attached to or integral with the barrel of a firearm, that is designed to reduce the sound of discharge by decreasing the velocity of escaping gases but maintaining a bullet’s high velocity. May also be referred to as a “silencer” however this term is a misnomer as the device does not silence sound, but functions more to suppress the sound.
