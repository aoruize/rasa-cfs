           Introduction
          </strong>
         </h4>
         <p class="normal">
          Most firearms are designed by manufacturers to contain safeties, which are devices on a firearm intended to provide protection against accidental discharge under normal usage when properly engaged. The trigger pull of a firearm is set by the manufacturer and indicates the average force that needs to be applied to the trigger to cause it to discharge. Firearms safety tests are performed to determine whether or not the firearm will accidentally discharge despite safety designs and when not pulling the trigger and to report on the trigger pull for the firearm.
         </p>
         <p class="normal">
          Accidental discharge testing involves testing a firearm under conditions of abusive mishandling to determine whether or not it exhibits tendencies to accidentally discharge. The testing performed is modelled on the SAAMI (Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers’ Institute) voluntary performance standards for test procedures to evaluate new designs of rifles, shotguns and handguns. The SAAMI standard does not apply to muzzle loading and black powder firearms of any type, nor is the standard appropriate for firearms intended for formal target shooting and whose trigger pull is designed to be less than 3 pounds (1.36 kg). All accidental discharge testing is conducted with the firearm chambered with an empty primed case of its designated cartridge. The testing includes dropping a firearm in one or two conditions, safe carrying and maximum readiness, from various heights and in different attitudes

          Depending on the specific design of the firearm or the case history additional testing not referenced in the SAAMI standard may be conducted.

          During testing parts breakage or other damage resulting from testing does not constitute failure as long as the empty primed case does not fire and the firearm can be unloaded safely after each drop.
