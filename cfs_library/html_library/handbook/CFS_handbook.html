          The following precautions are necessary to maintain the integrity of the evidence and ensure safety:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Always wear gloves and protective clothing when handling and packaging evidential samples and change the gloves/protective clothing when contaminated and when handling items from different sources.

          <li>
           When using disposable utensils (

          </li>
          <li>
           Use water or alcohol to wipe scissors or forceps between the collection of different samples to prevent contamination. It is preferable to decontaminate such re-useable tools with a 1% bleach solution.
          </li>
          <li>
           Keep comparison samples (

          <li>
           Shipping containers used to send evidence must be properly packaged to avoid any damage and/or deleterious effects during transit. For more information about packaging and special delivery services, refer to the service courierâs website or call the sectionâs scientific advisor.
          </li>
          <li>
           Containers that have evidence must be âproperly sealedâ to ensure continuity and to protect the contents from loss, cross-transfer, or contamination.
           <ul>
            <li>
             A container is âproperly sealedâ only if its contents cannot readily escape and only if entering the container results in obvious damage to the container and/or seal.

           </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
           Boxes, envelopes and other containers must be sealed by firmly applying tamper evident tape across each potential opening (

            e.g.
           </abbr>
           top and bottom of box) of a container and initialling the tape.
           <ul>
            <li>
             Tamper-evident tape, which is tape that provides an indication that a container has been tampered with, should be used to ensure that a container is properly sealed.

If the seal is also used to ensure that a container is properly sealed, it should be placed in a way that when entering the container results in obvious damage to the seal.
           <ul>
            <li>
             Stickers, labels, non-evidence tape and portions of seals are not considered to be continuity seals.

           </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
           If possible, avoid applying seals over pertinent information on items (

            e.g.

           Air-dry items that are wet and/or stained with wet blood or other body fluids to prevent decomposition, except when requesting an examination for volatile ignitable liquids (
