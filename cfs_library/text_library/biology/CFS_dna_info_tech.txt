Introduction

DNA is the genetic blueprint of life and is packaged into paired structures known as chromosomes. One from each pair is contributed by an individual’s biological mother and the other by his/her biological father. With the exception of identical twins, no two individuals have exactly the same DNA .

One particular pair of chromosomes includes the information required for gender determination. In males, one of the two chromosomes in this pair is known as the X chromosome, while the other is known as the Y chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes. A father passes his Y chromosome, unaltered, to each of his sons. This means that all paternally related males are expected to have the same Y chromosome DNA profile. The additional 22 pairs of chromosomes are called autosomal and are found in both males and females.

Forensic DNA analysis is used to determine the DNA profile of the donor of a bodily substance with a cellular component or to assess kinship. The CFS ) employs two types of analysis, one for autosomal and one for Y-chromosome DNA . Both systems are based on the testing of short tandem repeats ( STR ). STR and Y- STR analysis cannot be used to determine physical traits except for gender.

Examination for the Presence of DNA Sources

DNA analysis can be attempted on any bodily substance with a cellular component. Chemical tests can be used to locate body fluid stains that may be suitable for DNA analysis. The localization of a stain is not necessary in order to perform DNA analysis (see Limitations). Any item that may contain spermatozoa is processed to separate spermatozoal DNA , the “sperm fraction”, from other cellular DNA , the “epithelial fraction”. This process in called a differential extraction and is defined in the glossary below.

###
Biology - Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) Information
Extraction : Samples are processed to remove DNA from other cellular components. Depending on the sample this can be performed as either a conventional or differential extraction.


###
Biology - Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) Information
Quantification : An estimation of the quantity of male and total human (higher primate) DNA using Quantitative real-time PCR ) to determine if there is sufficient DNA to proceed with the analysis using STR and/or Y- STR analysis.

###
Biology - Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) Information
Amplification and Detection : Methods used to generate and sort multiple labeled copies of specific DNA regions to allow for detection. The regions of interest, STR s and Y- STR s, are short sequences of DNA that are distinguished by their number of repeats. Different commercially available kits target different sets of STR s.

###
Biology - Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) Information
Data analysis : Software packages are used to assess the number of repeats in each PCR ) product and assign internationally accepted designations to each PCR ) product.

###
Biology - Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) Information
Interpretation : DNA profiles are compared to each other to determine whether they can be excluded as originating from a common source or to assess kinship. DNA interpretation can be done either manually (by the Scientist alone), or with the assistance of a probabilistic genotyping software system called STR mix TM .

###
Biology - Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) Information
Quality Assurance: Prior to being reported or uploaded to the National DNA Databank, all DNA profiles that are suitable for comparison are subject to a search against a Quality Assurance database.
Any resulting hits are investigated to determine whether the mechanism of the DNA association could be due to an adventitious match or due to a contamination event within the laboratory.
How the DNA results are reported will depend on the outcome of the quality assurance evaluation.

###
Biology - Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) Information
Statistical analysis (Autosomal) : Associations between interpreted DNA profiles and known individuals will either be expressed as a Random Match Probability ( RMP ) or a Likelihood Ratio ( LR ). The statistical analysis used depends on the question to be answered and the manner in which the interpretation was performed.
Five databases representing the population of Ontario (Asians, Blacks, Caucasians, East Indians, and Northern Ontario Natives) are used to perform the statistical analysis. The most conservative statistic from all five databases is reported.
The CFS ) has population data for the core 13 CODIS ) STR loci only. The CFS ) does not have population data for the additional loci, contained within the Identifiler ® Plus, PowerPlex ® 16 HS, or GlobalFiler ® Express systems. All comparable loci are evaluated when a comparison is made between two DNA profiles however the additional loci are not included in probability calculations.
CFS ) population databases have been assessed by a qualified population geneticist/statistician and have been approved for forensic use.

###
Biology - Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) Information
Random Match Probability:
Random match probability estimates usually differ by less than a factor of 10 in either direction when different samples from the same population are compared.
This estimate is only valid for unrelated people, as there would be a greater probability of coincidental matching DNA profiles among close relatives.

###
Biology - Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) Information
Likelihood Ratio:
Likelihood Ratio point estimates usually differ by less than a factor of 10 in either direction when different samples from the same population are compared.
The estimate is specific to the pair of hypotheses being tested. These hypotheses are formulated by the Scientist in considering the relevant question(s) to be answered and will represent two alternative explanations for the data. Different sets of hypotheses will result in different likelihood ratios. In certain scenarios it may be relevant to address alternate hypotheses involving familial relationships.

###
Biology - Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) Information
Statistical Analysis (Y- STR ): Because the Y chromosome is inherited as a single unit, the statistical analysis of DNA results generated using male-specific DNA testing differs from the statistical analysis used for autosomal DNA testing.
For Y chromosome DNA profiles, statistics are calculated based on the frequency with which a particular Y chromosome profile has been observed in a North American population database.
Statistical analyses are limited by the size of the population database searched and are generally less discriminating than those associated with autosomal DNA analysis.
When reporting results associated with Powerplex ® -Y analysis, a confidence limit is incorporated in the random match probability to account for uncertainty related to the database size and sampling variation.
A likelihood ratio is provided when results from Powerplex ® -Y23 are reported. This indicates the likelihood of the DNA results obtained if the haplotype in question is from the individual being considered, relative to a randomly selected individual from the same population.

###
Biology - Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) Information
Interpretation of DNA Mixtures

Interpretation of DNA profiles is typically straightforward but on occasion can be complex. Various scientific parameters are considered together and in combination with case specific information (item type, body fluid findings and context). These include:

    - number of contributors
    - relative proportions of each contributor
    - quantity of DNA
    - peak heights
    - concordance of peaks
    - locus balance.

In addition, any assumptions made in the process of mixture interpretation are documented in the case work notes and must be supportable.

Interpretation of results includes a formal quality assurance process that relies on validation experiments, interpretation guidelines and the collective experience of the DNA laboratory. This ensures that the conclusions reached are supported by the scientific data.

Some DNA profiles, or minor contributors within DNA mixtures, may be reported as ‘Not suitable for comparison’. This is due to uncertainty with respect to the total number of contributors and/or the low or relative amounts of DNA present.

DNA profiles which have been assigned a DNA profile number within a given report/case (i.e. Profile 1, Profile 2, Profile 3) are considered suitable for comparison.  Unless otherwise specified, different DNA profile numbers indicate that the profiles originate from different individuals.

###
Biology - Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) Information
Limitations

    1. A minimum amount of DNA required for PCR ) has been established below which no further analysis is generally performed either with autosomal or Y-chromosome amplification systems.  In this situation, male DNA may or may not have been detected.
    2. In the presence of an excess of female DNA , it is possible that male DNA will be detected in a sample but a male DNA profile will not be generated.
    3. Poor quality DNA may give partial or no results depending on the extent of damage to the DNA .
    4. Some substances may inhibit the PCR ) process leading to partial or no results.
    5. In the case of Y- STR DNA profiles, males from the same paternal lineage will typically share the same DNA profile. When a mutation occurs, it results in a difference in Y- STR profiles between individuals from the same paternal line.  Unrelated males will likely be distinguished using this application. For PowerPlex ® Y23 profiles, a close relative is considered a biological father or brother, with the same biological father.
    6. It is possible to touch/handle/wear an item and not deposit any detectable levels of DNA .  A DNA profile determined from a touched/handler/wearer sample is not necessarily from the habitual user/wearer or from the person that last touched/handled/wore the item.
    7. If an object is touched/handled/worn by more than one individual, it is possible that any DNA profile generated will be a mixture of DNA from different individuals.
    8. It is not unusual to find detectable levels of DNA from single or multiple depositions (referred to as background DNA ) on clothing. This may limit the significance of the DNA results.
    9. Within certain timeframes it is not unusual to find detectable levels of DNA from prior consensual activity on internal samples. Submission of a comparison sample from the consensual partner may assist with interpretation of these results.
    10. When the case history suggests prior consensual contact with the same individual who is believed to be the perpetrator of a sexual assault, the significance of the DNA results may be limited.
    11. A mixture of DNA from more than one person can limit the ability to define contributing profiles and thus decrease the ability to exclude a particular individual from being a contributor to that mixture. Additionally, when an individual cannot be excluded under these circumstances, the significance may be limited.
    12. STR mix TM may be able to resolve DNA profiles from mixtures in cases where manual interpretation cannot. Not all DNA profiles are suitable for STR mix TM analysis. In some cases, after STR mix™ analysis, the Scientist may determine that the DNA results as a whole, or in part, are still not suitable for comparison.
    13. Occasionally the results obtained from multiple samples suggest that either the same individual or subset of individuals is/are the source of all the observed results. It may not be necessary to fully interpret every sample as these interpretations may not add further value to the investigation. When this occurs it will be clearly articulated in the report.
    14. It is not always possible to attribute a DNA profile to a body fluid or cellular source. Typically touch/handler/wearer DNA testing is performed in the absence of body fluid testing.
    15. DNA results may or may not assist in addressing how or when the DNA was deposited.

DNA Glossary

Likelihood Ratio (LR) : Addresses the probability of having observed the evidence under one hypothesis relative to the probability of having observed the evidence under a second hypothesis.

For Y- STR associations using the multiplex Powerplex ® -Y23, the weight of the association between DNA profiles is expressed by a LR.

For mixture deconvolutions using STR mix TM the weight of the association will be expressed using an LR.

DNA profiles from multiple samples may originate from a common source, but may have different LRs.

The reader of the report should ensure they are aware which specific LRs apply to which items. This is to avoid attributing a greater significance to a test result than the results for that test support.

Random match probability (RMP) : The probability that a randomly selected individual unrelated to the reference person would coincidentally share the observed DNA profile. This is a statement of weight provided in the event of associations between DNA profiles (excluding those associated through kinship analyses).

DNA profiles from multiple samples may originate from a common source, but may have a different RMP. In general, the RMP for the sample with the highest discrimination potential is reported. The associated footnote will also capture the other RMPs for the same individual.

The reader of the report should ensure they are aware which specific RMP applies to the item results. This is to avoid attributing a greater significance to a test result than the results for that test support.

For Y- STR associations using the multiplex Powerplex ® -Y, the random match probability is adjusted, using an upper 95% confidence limit, to incorporate uncertainty due to sampling error and database.
