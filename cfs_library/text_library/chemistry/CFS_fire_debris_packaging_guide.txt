Chemistry - Fire Debris Packaging Guide


Type of Sample 	***Required*** 	Recommended
Fire Debris
Security-sealed Mason jar
1 litre mason jar 	Use Glass Mason jars with metal cap and ring, except for larger items and liquid samples (see below).
If alcohols, solvents or lacquer thinners are suspected, it is recommended that only glass Mason jars are used. 	

    Leave air space for sampling (approx. ¾ full)
    Ensure the mouth of jar is clean of debris, and that the metal ring and lid are tightly-sealed
    Apply numbered, tamper-proof security seal to jar
    Place protective netting over jar
    Seal jar in a nylon bag if the item has a noticeable petroleum odour
    Submit an empty jar for comparison purposes

Large Items
(Any items that cannot fit into a 1L Mason jar)
Swan neck seal
“Swan neck” seal 	

Use only specialty nylon bags.
Garbage bags, paper bags, Ziploc bags, and standard police evidence bags are not suitable for retaining volatile ignitable liquid vapours. Items packaged in these types of bags will not be accepted for analysis.
If alcohols, solvents or lacquer thinners are suspected, it is recommended that only glass Mason jars are used.
	

    Leave air space in bag to allow for sampling
    Seal the bag using one of the following methods:
        "Swan neck" seal: twist neck of bag, fold over and secure with cable-tie or tape. Seal the opening of nylon bag with duct tape.
        Fold the opening of the bag over on itself at least three times and seal with duct tape.
    Double-bag the item if it is heavy, very wet, has sharp edges or has a strong petroleum odour
    Nylon bags should not be sealed with adhesive tape that has printed lettering ( e.g. " OFM " tape)
    Items in bags should be small enough to fit into a conventional microwave

Liquids 	Liquids must be received upright with no visible signs of leakage. Ensure that lids are closed tightly. 	

    Use Glass vials (20mL) with a foil lined lid
    Ship liquid items separately from other items
    If a Mason jar must be used to package a liquid, submit no more than 50mL (~1/4 cup), and seal the jar in a nylon bag to prevent leakage

Soil / Vegetation / Food 	Refrigerate as soon as possible to reduce the possibility of bacterial action. 	
Lung and Biological Tissue 	Use only glass Mason jars with a metal cap and ring.

    Jars must not be more than ¾ full
    All lung submissions must have an analysis request for either ignitable liquids and/or hydrocarbon gases (such as natural gas and propane)

	

    Submit an empty jar for comparison purposes

Clothing 	Suspect or victim clothing should be packaged in glass Mason jars or specialty nylon bags.
If clothing was packaged after 24 hours, contact a fire debris analyst to discuss suitability for examination. 	

    Suspect clothing should be packaged within 24 hours of the occurrence. If clothing was packaged after 24 hours, contact a fire debris analyst to discuss suitability for examination.
    Victim clothing with biological fluid or tissue should be refrigerated if possible

Comparison Samples:

Whenever possible, an unburnt/unused comparison sample of debris (e.g. unburnt carpet sample, wood, etc. ), or of a substrate used to collect a liquid ( e.g. a paper towel wipe), should also be submitted for analysis. This will help to account for contributions made to the analytical results by the debris and substrate materials.

Mason Jars

Any retail kitchen or hardware store (1L size recommended).
Please Note: prior to use, jars should be cleaned by rinsing with hot water (no soap) and placed upside down to dry away from potential sources of ignitable liquid vapour. Clean jars should be stored with their lids on until they are used
