Documents - Examination for Indentations Information 

Introduction

Indented writing or indentations refers to a latent image that was transferred to a document through pressure exerted on its surface while in contact with an overlying document.

Examination

An item is examined for indented writing using:

    Oblique lighting together with the unaided eye and/or magnification
    An Electrostatic Detection Apparatus (ESDA)

Interpretation
Limitations/Factors

    Fingerprinting using ninhydrin and other solvents inhibits the development of indentations
    Thickness of paper
    Storage conditions (i.e. certain acetate coversheets may eliminate indentations)
    Pressure used to produce the writing on the source item causing the indentations
    Number/thickness of layers between the questioned and source item

Note

    Secondary impressions can be transferred from one sheet to another if the two have been in contact for a period of time
    The absence of decipherable indentations does not necessarily mean the questioned item was never in contact with other items but due to the limitations listed above, the indentations cannot be detected

Significance of findings

    Can be used to associate two or more documents to each other
    Can be used as an investigative aid in identifying the possible source of a document
    Indented writing can be identified as the product of a particular individual
